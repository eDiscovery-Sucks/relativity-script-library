# Relativity Script Library
## Overview
The Relativity Script Library is an open-source collection of high-quality scripts for Relativity - both supported versions of Relativity Server and RelativityOne. This library aims to help the eDiscovery community by providing reusable, reliable, and efficient scripts to tackle data manipulation and reporting needs within Relativity.

With this library, we’re hoping to reduce redundancy in script development, consolidate various solutions for common tasks, and promote a high standard for script quality across the Relativity community.

## Features
This library includes scripts focused on:
- **Data Manipulation**: Efficiently manage, organize, and modify data within Relativity.
- **Reporting**: Generate various types of reports to streamline workflows and provide insightful data views.
Scripts are designed to be straightforward and reliable, adhering to a standardized XML and SQL format.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To use these scripts, ensure that:
- Your environment is running a supported version of Relativity Server or RelativityOne.
- You have system administrator privileges within Relativity.
- The AllowAddOrEditScripts instance setting in Relativity is set to "true".

### Using the Scripts
Adding and executing scripts within Relativity is documented in [Relativity's Help Documentation](https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Relativity/Scripts.htm). Each script file in this repository follows a standardized XML structure, and users are encouraged to refer to the documentation for specific instructions on loading and executing scripts within their environment.
